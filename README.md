# The_amazon_clone

Created a responsive frontend that mirrors Amazon's UI/UX, featuring 4 main pages—login, sign-up, cart, and home—ensuring seamless transitions between them. Developed a product detail page showcasing images, descriptions, and reviews, and designed a shopping cart with a basic, non-functional checkout flow.
